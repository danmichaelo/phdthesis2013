Many methods, technologies, standards, and languages exist to structure and
describe data. The aim of this thesis is to find common features among these
methods to determine how data is actually structured and described. Existing
studies are limited to 'numeric' notions of data or they presume unquestioned
concepts such as 'records' or 'schemas'. In this thesis data is analysed as
signs, communicated in form of digital documents, to semiotically deconstruct
such concepts. Properties of methods of data structuring and description of all
kinds (encodings, identifiers, formats, schemas, models...) were collected and
experienced critically by a phenomenological research method. The analysis
resulted in a) six prototypes to categorize data methods by their primary
purpose, b) five basic paradigms that deeply shape how data is structured and
described in practice, and c) a pattern language of data structuring. The
identified patterns, each described with its benefits, consequences, pitfalls,
and relations to other patterns, show problems and solutions which occur over
and over again, independent from particular technologies.  The results can help
to better understand data and its actual forms, both for consumption and
creation of data.
