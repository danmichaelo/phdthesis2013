In short, this is what [my PhD thesis](publications.html#thesis) is about:

> **metadata** /ˈmɛtədeɪtə/ \
data that describes other data. 

The full story, however, is a bit more complex. I wrote "something about data".
This [little website](https://github.org/jakobib/phdthesis2013/tree/gh-pages)
is about this *something*.

Feedback is highly appreciated -- just cite me, create 
[a GitHub issue](https://github.org/jakobib/phdthesis2013/issues) 
or do some interesting research of your own! The full content of my
thesis can be reused unter the conditions of CC-BY-SA license -- ideas
are free to be shared anyway.
